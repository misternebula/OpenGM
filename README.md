# OpenGM

## What is this?
This program aims to run Gamemaker Studio games, emulating the original games as closely as possible. The assembly code of the game is parsed and executed in a stack-based system, and the built-in Gamemaker functions are replicated too.

## How do I get this running with a game?
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A lot of this is temporary, since the project is (relatively) unfinished. A better way of loading games is planned.
1. Build the project.
2. Navigate to (or create) `\OpenGM\OpenGM\bin\game\`
3. Place all files and folders from the game folder into this folder.
5. Run the project.
6. OpenGM should now convert the games `data.win` into a file named `data_OpenGM.win`. *This is not the same file format as the original file.* This file is a compressed file used to store intermediary data that OpenGM use.

If any errors occur, OpenGM probably does not support features of the GameMaker version the game uses.

## Supported Games
Ideally, any Gamemaker game should work. However, it's impossible to support every single quirk of every single engine version.

The following games are used in development to test feature parity, and as such OpenGM should support any game running on the same engine version as these games :

| Game | Engine Version |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| DELTARUNE                                    | 2022.0.3.104 |
| DELTARUNE Chapter 1 & 2 DEMO (LTS Branch)    | 2022.0.3.99  |
| DELTARUNE Chapter 1 & 2 DEMO                 | Unknown      |
| DELTARUNE Chapter 1 (SURVEY_PROGRAM)         | Unknown      |
| Undertale                                    | 1.0.0.1539   |
| Pizza Tower SAGE 2019 Demo                   | 2.2.2.302    |
| Pizza Tower Eggplant Build                   | 2022.3.0.497 |

Not every feature from these games may work, but the game will at least load and try to execute.

The following games are planned to be tested at some point:
| Game  | Engine Version |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| FAITH: The Unholy Trinity v1.5               | Unknown      |
